spring-security3.2-mvc
=====================

Example application where I tried a few non-standard things with Spring Security 3.2 (Custom X509 Filter and Provider).  

Also included:

 - Spring 4
 - Spring MVC 4
 - JSR250 annotations
 
In all cases tried to use Java configuration for all parts (MVC, Security, and Core)
